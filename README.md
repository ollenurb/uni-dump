# University Notes
This repo contains notes and exercises that I've done during my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Turin. 
Notes has been written in italian since it's my mother tongue and basically 90% of the courses were in italian.

Each course has its own notes pack which in turn can be compiled from markdown notes using pandoc. 
Since pandoc supports different format I also added makefile rules to generate the output in different formats like `epub`, `pdf` and `html`.
