# Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems - MFN0795

The course introduces the basic programming models for parallel and distributed
programming, specifically emphasising parallel programming. The main goal is to
provide students with methods and tools to face the complexity of the design of
parallel applications on top of basic programming models: shared-memory,
message-passing, and SIMD. Methodologically, the course introduces the first
parallel computer architectures and foundational aspects of parallel and
distributed programming (parallel activities, synchronisation, communication).
These concepts are then exemplified by examples of interest for the course of
study of the students (e.g. scientific computing).
