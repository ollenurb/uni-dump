# Neural Networks and Deep Learning - INF0188

The course allows to acquire the basic skills related to main models of neural
networks, both from the theoretical-mathematical point of view and from the
point of view of application and their use. Starting from the study of
elementary components, i.e. neurons, we deal with main network models and most
known training rules. Deep learning foundations will also be analised.
