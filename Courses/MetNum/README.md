# Metodi Numerici - MNF0962

This course contributes to the educational objectives of the mathematical field
of the Master's Degree in Computer Science. This course is about the methods and
techniques for the accurate and efficient numerical solution of mathematical
problems and for the correct intrepretation of the output of the corresponding
algorithms. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of numerical errors
and to the computational aspects. The course is completed by practical sessions
in the lab, where the scientific software MATLAB is employed to solve problems
of numerical mathematics in a scientific computing environment.
