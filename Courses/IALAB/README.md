# Artificial Intelligence (with experimentations) - MFN0942

The main objective of the course is to provide a deep investigation of
Artificial Intelligence, in particular concerning the abilities of an
intelligent agent to perform inferences from an explicit knowledge base of a
given domain. In addition to methodological skills, also project development
skills will be taken into account, since the course comprises the
experimentation of automated reasoning mechanisms based on logic programming, as
well as the development of an intelligent agent able to exhibit both
deliberative and reactive behaviors (by using tools based on production rules)
and the use of tools for cognitive architectures. This course provides a
contribution towards the objectives in the field of "Systems for data management
and manipulation" of the Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Informatica.
