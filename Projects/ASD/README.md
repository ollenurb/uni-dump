# Algorithms and Data Structures

This projects consists of 4 different exercises that requires the implementation
and usage of custom Data Structures and their corresponding Algorithms that use
them. The requirements were as follows:

* Exercise 1: Implements a linked list in `C`.
* Exercise 2: Implements an edit distance recursive function (also in `C`). Then
  implements a simple program that suggest the correct word for each wrong word
  that occurs in a text corpus.
* Exercise 3: Implement a Union-Find Set data structure in `Java`.
* Exercise 4: Implement both a Graph data structure and the minimum spanning
  tree algorithm (Kruskal).

Also a test suite has been implemented for each exercise implementation (unit
test).

## Running

Just `cd` into the Exercise directory that you want to run, then `./build.sh`.
After the build process finished, you can run the generated executable.
