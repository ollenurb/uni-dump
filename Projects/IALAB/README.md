This projets consists of 3 different experimentations concerning:

* Informed search algorithms (A*, IDA*) in a railway domain implemented in
  Prolog.
* An expert system that plays a simplified version of the battleship game
  implemented in CLIPS.
* An agent that learns to escape an environment using reinforcement learning,
  implemented in SOAR.
