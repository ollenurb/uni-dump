# Software Engineering: Advanced Architectures and Techniques

This project consists of 3 different experimentations:
* Backend that exposes a set of GraphQl endpoints that follows a microservice
  architecture.
* An Android frontend.
* A Web (React) frontend.

With this different projects we (together with my team) had the opportunity to
use and explore different technologies such as:

* Kotlin (a modern JVM language)
* Coroutines (structured concurrency support given by Kotlin)
* Spring WebFlux (a reactive programming framework)
* GraphQl (framwork to ergonomically use API endopoints)
* JetPack Compose (a modern UI framework developed by Google)
