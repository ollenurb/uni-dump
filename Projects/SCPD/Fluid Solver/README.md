cuLBM provides two implementations (one with GPU support and one without) of a
2D fluid solver based on the [Lattice-Boltzmann
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods). The goal of
the project is to apply parallelization techniques discussed in the course, and
to empirically evaluate speedups.

## Installation
In order to compile the program, you need to have installed in your system `CUDA
Toolkit` and `cmake`. If the requirements are satisfied, just clone this
repository, then `cmake install` inside. 

## Program modes and configuration
The program can run in 3 different modes, which can be set on the `config.ini`
file under `res`:

* **`paraview`**: writes the fluid solution in a .vtk file at the end of the program.
* **`realtime`**: uses SDL2 to simulate the fluid in real time.
* **`benchmark`**: calculates the number of grid updates per second of the solver.

The configuration file `config.ini` is also used to set up other parameters of the simulation:

* `width`: width of the simulation space
* `height`: height of the simulation space
* `velocity`: fluid velocity on each lattice site at `t=0`
* `viscosity`: fluid viscosity
* `gpu`: set if the simulation must be run with hardware acceleration

## Report
The final report (written in Italian) can be found inside the `report`
directory. To generate the `pdf`, install `pandoc` and run `make`.
