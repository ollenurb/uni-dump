# Projects Archive

Here is an archive of all the projects that I developed (both alone and in team)
during my university career.

## List

* [Intelligent Agents](AgInt) - Japanese Auction Simulation.
* [Algorithms and Data Structures](ASD) - Various Data Structures and Algorithms
  implementations.
* [Formal Languages and Compilers](LFT) - JVM compiler for a simple programming
  language.
* [Networking Programming](ProgIII) - Chat application (both client and server),
  with a modern UI.
* [Operating Systems](SO) - Social simulation that uses processes and
  synchronization primitives.
* [Parallel and Distributed Programming](SCPD)
    * [1](SCPD/Fluid%20Solver) - Fluid simulation software written in CUDA (with
      GPU acceleration).
    * [2](SCPD/Mandelbrot) - Software that computes the Mandelbrot set using the
      message passing paradigm.
* [Web Technologies](TWEB)
    * [1](TWEB/Backend) - Backend (REST endpoint) for the application written using Java
      Servlets.
    * [2](TWEB/Frontend%20Web) - Web frontend for the application written using `Vue.js`.
    * [3](TWEB/Frontend%20Android) - Android frontend for the application.
* [Artificial Intelligence (with experimentations)](IALAB)
    * [1](IALAB/Prolog) - Informed search strategies concerning the railway
      domain, implemented in Prolog.
    * [2](IALAB/CLIPS) - An expert system developed in CLIPS that plays a
      simplified version of the battleship game.
    * [3](IALAB/SOAR) - Simulation of an agent that learns to escape an
      environment using reinforcement learning on the SOAR cognitive
      architecture.
