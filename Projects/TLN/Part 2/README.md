# Natural Language Processing - Part 2
This project consists of 3 experimentations that showcase respectively:

1. The usage of a lexical database such as WordNet to implement a Word-Sense
   disambiguation algorithm (Lesk).
2. An *n-gram* language model implemented from scratch, trained on a corpus made
   of Donald Trump tweets.
3. A document classifier model, based on the so called *"Rocchio Method"*.
